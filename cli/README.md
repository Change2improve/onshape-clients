#Onshape Clients CLI
This is the cli for managing generating, installing, testing and publishing all the Onshape clients. To get started, run "onshape-clients --help".

## Installing
You need Python 3.6+ for this package to work. If you have that, installation is as simple as `pip install .`.

## Testing
For testing instructions, see within "testing cli" comments in .travis.

## Motivation
To keep all of the various commands for all the different distribution channels, testing platforms, etc... all under one entry point.
